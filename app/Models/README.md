# Laravel Models üìÇ

The `app/Models` folder contains the Eloquent models that represent and interact with the application's database tables. Each model is tied to a specific table and encapsulates the business logic for managing its data.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Models Work in Laravel

1. **Database Mapping**:
   Each model corresponds to a table in the database and provides a simple interface for interacting with it.

2. **Eloquent ORM**:
   Laravel's Eloquent ORM simplifies complex database operations by using intuitive syntax.

3. **Relationships**:
   Models define relationships that express how database tables are connected, such as one-to-many and many-to-many.

4. **Mass Assignment**:
   Fields that can be mass-assigned are specified in the `$fillable` property to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Models Focused**:
   Each model should manage a single database table and its associated business logic.

2. **Use Relationships**:
   Define relationships to simplify data fetching and linking related tables.

3. **Secure Data**:
   Use the `$fillable` or `$guarded` property to control which fields are safe for mass assignment.

4. **Leverage Scopes**:
   Use query scopes to encapsulate reusable query logic within the model.

By organizing the application's data interactions within these models, Laravel ensures clean, maintainable, and scalable code for managing complex database operations.
