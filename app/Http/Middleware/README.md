# Laravel Middleware 📂

Middleware in Laravel provides a convenient mechanism to filter and process HTTP requests entering your application. Middleware can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, CSRF protection, or customizing request handling for specific routes.

This folder contains custom middleware that enhances and extends the functionality of your Laravel application.

## 📂 Folder Structure Overview

### 1. **`HandleInertiaRequests.php`**

-   **Purpose**: Middleware specific to Inertia.js for handling shared data across all Inertia responses.
-   **Key Characteristics**:
    -   Passes global shared data to all Inertia responses.
    -   Automatically includes session data, such as flash messages or auth information.
-   **Example Usage**:
    ```php
    public function share(Request $request): array
    {
        return array_merge(parent::share($request), [
            'auth' => [
                'user' => $request->user(),
            ],
            'flash' => [
                'success' => session('success'),
                'error' => session('error'),
            ],
        ]);
    }
    ```
-   **How it Works**:
    -   Extends `Inertia\Middleware` to customize shared data for every Inertia request.
-   **Use Case**:
    Automatically passes user data or flash messages to your Inertia.js frontend.

## 🛠️ How Middleware Works in Laravel

1. **Request Lifecycle**:

    - Middleware processes incoming requests before they reach the controller.
    - Middleware can modify the request, validate it, or halt further processing.

2. **Middleware Registration**:

    - Middleware is registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
    - Example:
        ```php
        protected $routeMiddleware = [
            'auth.redirect' => \App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfUnauthenticated::class,
            'inertia.handle' => \App\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests::class,
        ];
        ```

3. **Assigning Middleware**:
    - Middleware can be applied globally, to route groups, or individual routes.
    - Example:
        ```php
        Route::middleware(['auth.redirect'])->group(function () {
            Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index']);
        });
        ```

## 📋 Best Practices for Middleware

1. **Keep Middleware Focused**:

    - Each middleware should handle a single responsibility, such as authentication or logging.

2. **Use Middleware Groups**:

    - Combine multiple middleware into groups for efficient route handling.
        ```php
        protected $middlewareGroups = [
            'web' => [
                \App\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests::class,
                \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
            ],
        ];
        ```

3. **Chain Middleware**:

    - Middleware can pass the request to the next middleware in the chain using the `$next` function.

4. **Global vs. Route-Specific Middleware**:
    - Use global middleware for tasks like request trimming or logging.
    - Use route-specific middleware for tasks like authentication or API throttling.
