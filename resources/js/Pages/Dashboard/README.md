## Best Practices

-   **Modular Design**: Keep the logic for each feature within its corresponding page to ensure maintainability.
-   **Reuse Components**: Use shared components for forms, tables, and modals to maintain consistency.
-   **Secure Access**: Ensure routes to these pages are protected with appropriate authentication and authorization middleware.

By structuring the dashboard pages in this organized way, the platform provides a robust and efficient admin interface.
