## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Routing**:

    - Each page is linked to a route defined in Laravel's `routes` files (e.g., `web.php` or `api.php`).
    - Example: `/movies` route loads `Movies.tsx`.

2. **Navigation**:

    - Use the `Inertia` library to navigate between pages seamlessly:
        ```tsx
        <Link href="/movies">Go to Movies</Link>
        ```

3. **Customization**:
    - Extend or modify these pages to add new features or update existing ones.
